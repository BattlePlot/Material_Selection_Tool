Mechanical properties

Brittleness: Ability of a material to break or shatter without significant deformation when under stress; opposite of plasticity, examples: glass, concrete, cast iron, ceramics etc.
Bulk modulus: Ratio of pressure to volumetric compression (GPa) or ratio of the infinitesimal pressure increase to the resulting relative decrease of the volume
Coefficient of restitution: The ratio of the final to initial relative velocity between two objects after they collide. Range: 0-1, 1 for perfectly elastic collision.
Compressive strength: Maximum stress a material can withstand before compressive failure (MPa)
Creep: The slow and gradual deformation of an object with respect to time.If the s in a material exceeds the yield point, the strain caused in the material by the application of load does not disappear totally on the removal of load. The plastic deformation caused to the material is known as creep. At high temperatures, the strain due to creep is quite appreciable.[1]
Ductility: Ability of a material to deform under tensile load (% elongation). It is the property of a material by which it can be drawn into wires under the action of tensile force. A ductile material must have a high degree of plasticity and strength so that large deformations can take place without failure or rupture of the material. In ductile extension, a material that exhibits a certain amount of elasticity along with a high degree of plasticity.[2]
Durability: Ability to withstand wear, pressure, or damage; hard-wearing
Elasticity: Ability of a body to resist a distorting influence or stress and to return to its original size and shape when the stress is removed
Fatigue limit: Maximum stress a material can withstand under repeated loading (MPa)
Flexibility: Ability of an object to bend or deform in response to an applied force; pliability; complementary to stiffness
Flexural modulus
Flexural strength: Maximum bending stress a material can withstand before failure (MPa)
Fracture toughness: Ability of a material containing a crack to resist fracture (J/m^2)
Friction coefficient: The amount of force normal to surface which converts to force resisting relative movement of contacting surfaces between material pair
Hardness: Ability to withstand surface indentation and scratching (e.g. Brinell hardness number)
Malleability: Ability of the material to be flattened into thin sheets under applications of heavy compressive forces without cracking by hot or cold working means.This property of a material allows it to expand in all directions without rupture.[3]
Mass diffusivity: Ability of one substance to diffuse through another
Plasticity: Ability of a material to undergo irreversible or permanent deformations without breaking or rupturing; opposite of brittleness
Poisson's ratio: Ratio of lateral strain to axial strain (no units)
Resilience: Ability of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically (MPa); combination of strength and elasticity
Shear modulus: Ratio of shear stress to shear strain (MPa)
Shear strength: Maximum shear stress a material can withstand
Slip: A tendency of a material's particles to undergo plastic deformation due to a dislocation motion within the material. Common in Crystals.
Specific modulus: Modulus per unit volume (MPa/m^3)
Specific strength: Strength per unit density (Nm/kg)
Specific weight: Weight per unit volume (N/m^3)
Stiffness: Ability of an object to resist deformation in response to an applied force; rigidity; complementary to flexibility
Surface roughness: The deviations in the direction of the normal vector of a real surface from its ideal form
Tensile strength: Maximum tensile stress of a material can withstand before failure (MPa)
Toughness: Ability of a material to absorb energy (or withstand shock) and plastically deform without fracturing (or rupturing); a material's resistance to fracture when stressed; combination of strength and plasticity
Viscosity: A fluid's resistance to gradual deformation by tensile or shear stress; thickness
Yield strength: The stress at which a material starts to yield plastically (MPa)
Young's modulus: Ratio of linear stress to linear strain (MPa)
